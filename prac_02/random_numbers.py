# line 1
# print(random.randint(5, 20))
# Each print line generates a random integer in the range (5, 20).
# Smallest number = 5, largest number = 20

# line 2
# print(random.randrange(3, 10, 2))
# Each print line generates a random odd number in the range (3, 10) since it takes steps of 2 starting from 3.
# Smallest number = 3, largest number = 9
# It could not have produced a 4 since 4 is an even number.

# line 3
# print(random.uniform(2.5, 5.5))
# Each print line generates a random floating point number in the range (2.5, 5.5).
# Smallest number = 2.5, largest number = 5.5
